# micro-customer-service

This project contains source code for managing merchants

## Deploy the application

To deploy the application via serverless run:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
flexkart-auth-service$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `hello-world/package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
flexkart-auth-service$ sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
flexkart-auth-service$ sam local start-api
flexkart-auth-service$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
Events:
  HelloWorld:
    Type: Api
    Properties:
      Path: /hello
      Method: get
```
